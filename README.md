# Wikiproject Lakes Workshop

Description: People are increasingly looking towards the internet for information about specific natural areas such as lakes. However, basic information about these areas is often only available to non-professional scientists via scattered state-based web portals. One of the few general public-facing sources of this information that includes lake locations, types, and other characteristics is Wikipedia (https://wikipedia.org). However, because only a small fraction of lakes in the world have a dedicated page on Wikipedia, people are not able to easily find basic information about their local lake or lakes they might like to visit. During this workshop, participants will learn about the underlying structure of Wikipedia pages, recommended practices, and reasonable workflows for editing existing lake pages and for creating new ones.
